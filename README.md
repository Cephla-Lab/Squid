TODO: images

The Squid repo provides firmware and software for controlling [Cephla](https://cephla.com/)'s Squid microscope.

Applications include:
- slide scanner for digital pathology
- time lapse imaging with 2D or 3D tiling
- spatial omics that involves multicolor and multi-round imaging
- tracking microscopy
- computational microscopy, including label free microscopy using phase/polarization/reflectance + deep learning
- super resolution microscopy
- light sheet microscopy

## How to Start
### Software
#### Setting up and run Squid software on Linux
Ubuntu 22.04 is the most tested platform. Other Linux systems should work but performance is not guaranteed.

See [README](https://github.com/Cephla-Lab/Squid/blob/master/software/README.md) in `/software` directory for instructions.

After installation, you can run `python3 /software/tools/script_create_desktop_shortcut.py` to create a shortcut on Desktop.
#### Setting up and run Squid software on Windows
See this [post](https://forum.squid-imaging.org/t/setting-up-the-software-on-a-windows-computer/77) on Cephla forum for Windows instructions.

If your Squid has a laser auto-focus module, you will need to install the driver for the laser auto-focus camera and reboot the computer. [Download](TODO: link)

After installation, you can follow this [post](https://forum.squid-imaging.org/t/setting-up-desktop-shortcut-on-a-windows-computer/94) to create a shortcut on Desktop.
#### Setting up Cephla image stitcher
See the [image-stitcher repo](https://github.com/Cephla-Lab/image-stitcher)

### Firmware
Usually firmware should be already uploaded to the controller. If you do need to re-upload firmware, you may follow the instructions in this [post](https://forum.squid-imaging.org/t/setting-up-arduino-teensyduino-ide-for-uploading-firmware/36).

Latest firmware for main controller: https://github.com/Cephla-Lab/Squid/tree/master/firmware/octopi_firmware_v2/main_controller_teensy41
Latest firmware for joystick controller: https://github.com/Cephla-Lab/Squid/tree/master/firmware/octopi_firmware_v2/control_panel_teensyLC
